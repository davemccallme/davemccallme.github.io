Listen up y'all, here's the story
'Bout a quick brown fox, and his road to glory
He jumps over the lazy dog with ease
While the other animals just stand and freeze

He's got the speed and he's got the skill
The other animals just can't keep up, they're standing still
The fox is on fire, he's blazing through
Leaving all the haters in the rear view

So if you see a quick brown blur
You better watch out, 'cause that's the fox for sure
He's the king of the jungle, the prince of the game
The quick brown fox, forever in fame
